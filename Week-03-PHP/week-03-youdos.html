            <h3>Entry Level: Creating Functions</h3>
            <blockquote cite="https://mylearning.suny.edu/d2l/le/content/2514882/viewContent/54229984/View">
                <p>"In past programming courses, how have you decided when to create a function? Think of an example of a function you've created. What did it do? What inputs did it need (if any)? What outputs did it give (if any)?</p>
                <p>Additionally, find a built-in function in the PHP docs that you think you can explain and explain what it does in your own words"</p>

If you'd like, you can create a simple function as an example and reference the different parts of that example function (Like what I did here!)"</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Accessing a parameter outside of a function</li>
                <li>Accessing a global variable inside of a function</li>
